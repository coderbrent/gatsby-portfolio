<h1>Hello!</h1> 👋

<strong>Thanks for taking a moment to check out my portfolio on my Github!</strong>

Since my portfolio is a showcase of my projects and dev skills, I figured I'd use it as an opportunity to try a couple things:

🚀 <strong>Try something new (for me)</strong> - In this case it was to build a static site with Gatsby/GraphQL and deploy it with Netlify! It was something I'd heard a lot about and so I decided what the hey, lets do it!

✂️ <strong>Leave something out</strong> - I ditched working with a popular CSS framework in favor of rolling my own. I did this to get some exercise with building a mobile responsive site sans Bootstrap/Materialize/Bulma etc.

<h2>What's inside..</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Gatsby</li>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>What needs to be done..</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make styling more uniform across pages</li>
  <li>Dark theme!</li>
</ul>
