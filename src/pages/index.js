            Hello! My name is Brent <span></span> - I'm a front end web developer building

            I got my start as a
            programmer writing .bas files for AOL progs (remember punters?) in
            the 90's! I took a 15 year hiatus to start a limo company before
            getting back into software development! I currently work at Medscape/WebMD doing front end development with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

            In my free time I love hanging with my family, watching
            TV (I love paranormal{" "}
            <span role="img" aria-label="ghost">
              ðŸ‘»
            </span>{" "}
            shows!), reading and playing hockey.
