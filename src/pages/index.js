          <p className="sectionParagraphs">Hi! My name is Brent Abruzese - I'm a full stack web developer from Central New Jersey!
            I love spending time with my family, watching TV (I love paranormal <span role="img" aria-label="ghost">ðŸ‘»</span> shows!), 
            reading and playing hockey! I hav</p>

        <div className="sub-heading">why i <span role="img" aria-label="heart">ðŸ’—</span> to code</div>
          <p className="sectionParagraphs">What attracted me to web development was a love for creating and building cool things. 
            Back in the dial up days, I "picked up" a copy of Visual Basic 3.0 and began building
            punters and mass mailers on America Online like lots of other degenerate 90's youth! I did
            this for years until I had to get a "real job" and I tossed programming aside.</p>

        <div className="sub-heading">what i'm up to now</div>
          <p className="sectionParagraphs">After spending the last 7 years starting and growing a limousine service,
            my company began to really start feeling the effects of rideshare (Uber/Lyft). I had to
            close my company and lay off my 22 employees in October 2019. 
            It certainly stung, but it brought me full circle. I now bring my years of entreprenurial experience
            to web developing. I'm currently freelancing and hunting for an awesome company to join!</p>
