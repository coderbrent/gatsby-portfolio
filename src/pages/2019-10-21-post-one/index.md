Well that was fun!

It took me at *LEAST* 30 attempts to deploy my fancy new portfolio blog this evening. Ultimately it was the tried and true "start over from scratch" strategy that finally forced this bad boy up to the onlines.  

Like anything you develop an unhealthy new found obsession with, this Gatsby/Netlify combo has me feeling unstoppable - but as I've quickly grown accustomed to in this crazy world of web development - those highs can get low REAL fast :/
