I’ve been on the job hunt recently and I wanted to share a story with a (long)bit of wisdom I’ve gained by doing things the hard way! :)

I think this advice is relevant to all industries and fields, but I believe it’s _particularly_ applicable to my tech/software developer colleagues and connections who are out here with me fighting the good fight:

<h3><i><center>DO NOT underestimate the importance of getting good at interviewing!</center></i></h3>

Yep, stop that JavaScript tutorial right now, get in front of a mirror (or maybe even set up a mock zoom call with just yourself) and start trying to explain ANY topic you can out loud. Actually try it! If you don’t do a lot of interviewing (or teaching) you may find it difficult to put thoughts to words! When I first tried it I was absolutely all over the place “umm”ing and “ahhh”ing!

See, like most typical developers, I spend the vast majority of my time either reading about or writing code in my efforts to become more “hirable”. I’ve always figured the sharper my skills are, the more likely I’ll be able to crush my next interview…right?

Well, here’s my story: I recently found myself interviewing for my dream role with a company I adore. I’d actually completed a take home assessment and the follow up interview was a two hour panel style review with five engineers. I knew it was coming and I knew it would be intense, but rather than preparing for the act of actually interviewing, I instead continued reviewing material. Doh.

When the day came and that zoom light turned on, I froze. I _knew_ what I wanted to say, but I hadn’t prepared to actually _speak_ about it. I struggled to articulate the work I’d done. Instead, I sat there awkwardly scrolling up and down through once familiar directories and files bumbling on about who knows what to try and fill the silence. As you can probably imagine, I didn’t land that role.

While it was a painful experience, it helped me realize how important it is as a developer on the job market to take the interview process itself as seriously as I take any of my hands on coding work. I know I’m not saying anything here that’s never been said, but if you are a dev looking for work and you can’t explain what you know in an interview setting, it doesn’t matter how much you actually know!
