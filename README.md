**Hello! 👋

Thanks for taking a moment to check out my portfolio on my Github!

Since my portfolio is a showcase of my projects and dev skills, I figured I'd use it as an opportunity to try a couple things:

🚀 Try something new (for me) - In this case it was to build a static site with Gatsby/GraphQL and deploy it with Netlify! It was something I'd heard a lot about and so I decided what the hey, lets do it!

✂️ Leave something out - I ditched working with a popular CSS framework in favor of rolling my own. I did this to get some exercise with building a mobile responsive site sans Bootstrap/Materialize/Bulma etc.

Thanks!!
