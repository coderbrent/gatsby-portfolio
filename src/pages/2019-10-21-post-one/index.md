###Well that was fun!
So it took me at *LEAST* 30 attempts to deploy my fancy new portfolio blog this evening. Ultimately it was the tried and true "start over from scratch" strategy that finally forced this bad boy up to the onlines.  
  
In spite of the issues though, this being my first Gatsby site (and also my first time deploying with Netlify), I have to say, like eeeeeveryone else launching static sites these days with the Gatsby/Netlify combo - üéµ bada ba ba ba, I'm loving it. üçü The site/load speed is as advertised, the CI/CD is awesome and it's actually a lot of fun to tweak around with graphQL (you know, after figuring out WTF it even WAS).  

All in all, I'm excited to see what else I can do with this combo!
