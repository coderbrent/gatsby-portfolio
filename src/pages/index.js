            Hi! My name is Brent Abruzese - I'm a full stack web developer from Central New Jersey!
            I love spending time with my family, watching TV (I love paranormal ðŸ‘» shows!), 
            reading and playing hockey!

            What attracted me to web development was a love for creating and building cool things. 
            Back in the dial up days, I "picked up" a copy of Visual Basic 3.0 and began building
            punters and mass mailers on America Online like lots of other degenerate 90's youth! I did
            this for years until I had to get a "real job" and I tossed programming aside.

            <p>After spending the last 7 years starting and growing a limousine service,
            my company began to really start feeling the effects of rideshare (Uber/Lyft). I had to
            close my company and lay off my 22 employees in October 2019. 
            It certainly stung, but it brought me full circle.</p>
            
            <p>I now bring my years of entreprenurial experience
            to my coding. I'm currently freelancing and hunting for an awesome company to join!</p>
