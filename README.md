<h1>Hello!</h1> üëã

<strong>Thanks for taking a moment to check out my portfolio! Special thanks to Divyanshu Maithani for the lovely template/dark theme! I fell in love with his blog while researching ways to add dark modes to your Gatsby site. His excellent site can be found <a href="https://divyanshu013.dev/">here</a></strong>

Since my portfolio is a showcase of my projects and dev skills, I figured I'd use it as an opportunity to try a couple things:

üöÄ <strong>Try something new (for me)</strong> - In this case it was to build a static site with Gatsby/GraphQL and deploy it with Netlify! It was something I'd heard a lot about and so I decided what the hey, lets do it!

‚úÇÔ∏è <strong>Leave something out</strong> - I ditched working with a popular CSS framework in favor of rolling my own. I did this to get some exercise with building a mobile responsive site sans Bootstrap/Materialize/Bulma etc. I did use Emotion (part of the dark theme) and Google Fonts. The rest is straight flexbox and grit. 

<h2>What's inside..</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Gatsby</li>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>What needs to be done..</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improve accessibility</li>
  <li>Edit/Optimize project images</li>
  <li>Add a 'liking' system to the blog</li>
</ul>
