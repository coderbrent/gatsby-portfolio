One thing I've grown quite fond of over the last few months while at work has been test writing. I'm NGL, that's something I'd ever thought I'd say/type. I'd been tasked with writing some integration tests for our GraphQL mutations and queries, and so I went scouring the fantastic docs over at Cypress.io for some background.

As expected, the docs were sufficient enough to get me started writing some tests. I wanted to take a few minutes to walk through what I learned and perhaps help someone else along the way that maybe somehow hits my blog before Cypress's excellent docs!
