Working on my portfolio site has been a lot of fun! Prior to actually sitting down and coding it, I gave a lot of thought about how involved I wanted to get, or rather, how far down the overengineering hole I wanted to go with what should be a simple, static site.  
  
  Wayyyy back when (early 2000's?) I started a little web design
  business called "TimeDesign". When I designed the site, in an effort to impress potential clients, I busted out the Macromedia Flash/Dreamweaver combo and went to town tweening and tweaking an over-the-top 'site intro'. Looking back, while the tech is funny to think about now, it was really a different time in terms of designing - and it wasn't just me, everyone was really overdoing it!  

Nowadays, minimalist static sites are in. Lots of whitespace, vector graphics and client side code keep users focused and load times fast. Things are definitely different than when I first dabbled in web development. It's now an 'impress with less' world.  

So two questions going through my mind before doing this were:  


* Why not just build this site from scratch with no framework? Why go over the top with a static site? 

* Is building a simple portfolio site with React the same as building some massive, contrived flash intro to a website simply to 'impress'?
