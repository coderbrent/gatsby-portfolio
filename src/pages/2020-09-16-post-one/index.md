So after going back and forth trying to decide whether to host and maintain my own blog on my portfolio or simply just blog on my DEV.to, I decided on the former.

Why? For one, Gatsby has an interesting way of handling blogs (JAMstack style) and I was curious about building one that uses it.

Second, it's hip and trendy. I mean, like, everyone's tots raging on this markdown stuff. Hell, I'm wearing a wool ski hat in 100 degree weather right now while I look up ways to get a simple frigging image on this thing. Just kidding, it's like 60 degrees in New Jersey right now. Maybe I'll do a seasonal fall pumpkin theme on here.. hmm....
