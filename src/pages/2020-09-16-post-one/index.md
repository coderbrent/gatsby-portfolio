So after going back and forth trying to decide whether to build, host and maintain my own blog, or simply just use my DEV.to page, I decided on the former.

What's funny is I ***just*** read a tweet from someone (can't remember who, sorry) that said something along the lines of, ***"Don't worry about building out a blogging engine for your portfolio page - it's the content that counts".*** And I'm sitting there nodding, going "yep, yep, that's right".

Buuuuttttt I really wanted to use a static site generator and I'd been meaning to deploy something to Netlify, so here we are!

```js
//I'm just messing around here to see what the prism theme looks like!

const someArray = [1,2,[3,4],5];

console.log(someArray.flat());

//logs => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
